# Group your expenses

> This is the capstone project of the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum. This capstone project is completed as part of the Microverse remote software developement curriculum using the pair programming approach.

-In this project I created an expense log app where users can create an account with their username and add expenses spent per day. The expenses can be grouped and ungrouped into the names of their choice

-At Sign up, users can upload images for better UI and UX.

-Users can also view each expenses in each group.

-Users can track the total amount of their expenses.

-This project is built with the MVP approach.
